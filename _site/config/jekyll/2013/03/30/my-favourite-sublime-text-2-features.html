<p>Sublime Text 2 had been my favourite text editor after switching over from Coda. It offers a better feature set when it comes to writing code. These are my favourite features in Sublime Text 2.</p>

<h4 id='1_go_to_anywhere'>1. Go to anywhere</h4>

<p>Just hit <code>Cmd + P</code> and to quickly switch between any files in your project directory. It is even smart enough to recognize snake case/camel case filenames.<br /><img alt='Go to anywhere' src='http://i.imgur.com/6PMGAAR.png' /></p>

<h4 id='2_multiple_selections'>2. Multiple selections</h4>

<p>How did we live before multiple selections? Just hold the <code>Cmd</code> key and click on multiple areas in your code to edit several places at the same time. You can even hit <code>Cmd + D</code> to look for similar occurences of a particular word and edit all of them at the same time<br /><img alt='Multiple selections' src='http://i.imgur.com/kuh42cX.png' /></p>

<h4 id='3_split_editing'>3. Split Editing</h4>

<p>Split screens into 2,3,4 smaller views by hitting <code>Alt + Cmd + 1,2,3</code><br /><img alt='Split Editing' src='http://i.imgur.com/hd12LzA.png' /></p>

<h4 id='4_code_snippets'>4. Code Snippets</h4>

<p>You can create your own or download code snippets from the internet. When you type the abbreviation for the code and press <code>tab</code>, you get a whole snippet of code immediately. Just type <code>if</code> and press <code>tab</code> to get a block of if..else statement, and much more.<br /><img alt='Code Snippets' src='http://i.imgur.com/LTNmXZd.png' /></p>

<h4 id='5_indent_guides'>5. Indent Guides</h4>

<p>There are lines showing you the opening and closing html tags by default, which makes it really handy to spot unclosed tags.<br /><img alt='Indent Guides' src='http://i.imgur.com/LPpmJA7.jpg' /></p>
