<h4 id='product_manager'>Product Manager</h4>

<p>I am currently a <a href='http://pollenizer.com/what-is-a-lean-product-manager'>Lean Product Manager</a> at <a href='http://pollenizer.com'>Pollenizer</a>, one of the top startup incubator in Australia. This role has a good overlap between customer development and product management. We use <a href='http://theleanstartup.com/'>lean startup</a> principles - running experiments, measuring results, hacking growth, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development'>agile dev</a> and quick iterations.</p>

<h4 id='ruby_on_rails_programmer'>Ruby on Rails Programmer</h4>

<p>I have been writing apps with Ruby on Rails since 2011 and started doing commercial freelancing work in 2012. The most recent project is <a href='http://singaporetender.com'>Singapore Tender</a> where I implemented a role-based authentication system (Devise, CanCan), account activation system, nested model forms, image uploading (CarrierWave), daily email digests, paypal integration (ActiveMerchant), object-based searching (Ransack), and email campaign integration (Gibbon).</p>

<h4 id='frontend_designer'>Front-end Designer</h4>

<p>I use the latest in CSS technology (<a href='http://sass-lang.com'>SASS</a> - mixins, variables, <a href='http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap'>Twitter Bootstrap</a>, <a href='http://foundation.zurb.com'>Zurb Foundation</a>), and popular Javascript frameworks (<a href='http://jquery.com'>jQuery</a>, <a href='http://angularjs.org'>Angular JS</a>) to create modern-looking websites at a fraction of the time needed. As the saying goes- don&#8217;t re-invent the wheel.</p>

<h4 id='startup_founder'>Startup Founder</h4>

<p>I started 3 businesses in Singapore before moving to Sydney. Tagloop - An online store for pre-programmed NFC stickers, Gspot - A platform for launching referral campaigns on Facebook, and <a href='http://hastify.com'>Hastify</a> - An online food delivery website. At Hastify, we managed to raise $50,000 from the Singaporean Government, and subsequently an angel round from one of the founders of <a href='http://hungrygowhere.com'>Hungrygowhere</a>, the Yelp of Singapore</p>
