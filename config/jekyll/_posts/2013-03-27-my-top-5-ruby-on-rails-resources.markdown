title: My top 5 Ruby on Rails resources

---
I first started coding in Ruby in 2011 and I've felt in love with it ever since- mainly because of the community and support behind it. Listed below are the top 5 resources I used the most while I was learning this beautiful programming language.  

1. [Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book)  
This is THE book to pick up if you are just starting out with Ruby on Rails. It covers all the basics- What is MVC, setting up models, views and controllers, authentication systems, setting up databases, scaffolding and etc. I like how it starts you off with a test-driven development mindset as well.

2. [Rubymonk](http://rubymonk.com)  
What is the use of learning a framework like Rails if you dont have the right foundation which is the Ruby language? Rubymonk is here for that. They offer interactive Ruby tutorials in your browser. If you are a hands-on learner who likes to jump right into the code and have a crack at it- Rubymonk is for you.

3. [Railscasts](http://railscasts.com)  
This is by far my favourite and most-used resource. Ryan Bates (the man behind the website) records himself going through every one of the tutorials available on the site. He covers a broad range of topics for all levels of development skills. Here are some good ones: [Devise](http://railscasts.com/episodes/209-devise-revised), [Image Uploading](http://railscasts.com/episodes/253-carrierwave-file-uploads?view=asciicast), [Simple Form](http://railscasts.com/episodes/234-simple-form-revised?view=asciicast), [Site-wide Announcements](http://railscasts.com/episodes/103-site-wide-announcements?autoplay=true), and [Sending Emails](http://railscasts.com/episodes/61-sending-email-revised?view=asciicast)

4. [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com)  
Answers to all your Ruby questions lurk on StackOverflow. If you dont find the right answers, then you are not asking the right questions. (Try pasting in the error message- sometimes it works)

5. [Google](http://google.com)  
Last but not least, Google should be your first point of question if you get stuck on something. Most often it will show you the related StackOverflow articles, but sometimes it may lead you to a beautifully written tutorial for the subject, or a meticulously crafted blogpost (like this!).
