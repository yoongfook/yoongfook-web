These resources helped me speed things up when it comes to front end development. There are a lot of free stuff out there. Learn how to use them and please don't re-invent the wheel.  

1. [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)  
One of the most popular and best css framework ever.
2. [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)  
A really good css framework too! Has less out-of-the-box functionality compared to Twitter Bootstrap, but it is more designer-friendly and the UI elements look less generic.
3. [Typekit](https://typekit.com/)  
CDN hosted fonts by Adobe. Just include the kit (few lines of js) in your website, and you can use the fonts without defining font-face tags in your css.
4. [Animate.css](http://daneden.me/animate/)  
Plug-and-play css animations. Fade,flip,bounce,rotate your DOM elements.
5. [Garlic.js](http://garlicjs.org/)  
Persist form data locally until the form's submitted so that your user dont lose their data if they accidentally close their browser.
