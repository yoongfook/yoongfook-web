title: My favourite Sublime Text 2 features
---
Sublime Text 2 had been my favourite text editor after switching over from Coda. It offers a better feature set when it comes to writing code. These are my favourite features in Sublime Text 2.  

####1. Go to anywhere  
Just hit `Cmd + P` and to quickly switch between any files in your project directory. It is even smart enough to recognize snake case/camel case filenames.

####2. Multiple selections
How did we live before multiple selections? Just hold the `Cmd` key and click on multiple areas in your code to edit several places at the same time. You can even hit `Cmd + D` to look for similar occurences of a particular word and edit all of them at the same time

####3. Split Editing
Split screens into 2,3,4 smaller views by hitting `Alt + Cmd + 1,2,3`

####4. Code Snippets
You can create your own or download code snippets from the internet. When you type the abbreviation for the code and press `tab`, you get a whole snippet of code immediately. Just type `if` and press `tab` to get a block of if..else statement, and much more.

####5. Indent Guides
There are lines showing you the opening and closing html tags by default, which makes it really handy to spot unclosed tags.
