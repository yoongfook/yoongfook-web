<h4 id="prod">Product Manager</h4>
<p>I am currently a <%= link_to "Lean Product Manager", "http://pollenizer.com/what-is-a-lean-product-manager", :target => 'new'  %> at <%= link_to "Pollenizer", "http://pollenizer.com", :target => 'new'  %>, one of the top startup incubator in Australia. This role has a good overlap between customer development and product management. We use <%= link_to "lean startup", "http://theleanstartup.com/", :target => 'new'  %> principles - running experiments, measuring results, hacking growth, <%= link_to "agile dev", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development", :target => 'new'  %> and quick iterations.</p>
<h4 id="dev">Ruby on Rails Programmer</h4>
<p>I have been writing apps with Ruby on Rails since 2011 and started doing commercial freelancing work in 2012. The most recent project is <%= link_to "Singapore Tender", "http://singaporetender.com", :target => 'new'  %> where I implemented a role-based authentication system (Devise, CanCan),  account activation system, nested model forms, image uploading (CarrierWave), daily email digests, paypal integration (ActiveMerchant),  object-based searching (Ransack), and email campaign integration (Gibbon).</p>
<h4 id="design">Front-end Designer</h4>
<p>I use the latest in CSS technology (<%= link_to "SASS", "http://sass-lang.com", :target => 'new'  %> - mixins, variables, <%= link_to "Twitter Bootstrap", "http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap", :target => 'new'  %>, <%= link_to "Zurb Foundation", "http://foundation.zurb.com", :target => 'new'  %>), and popular Javascript frameworks (<%= link_to "jQuery", "http://jquery.com", :target => 'new'  %>, <%= link_to "Angular JS", "http://angularjs.org", :target => 'new'  %>) to create modern-looking websites at a fraction of the time needed. As the saying goes- don't re-invent the wheel.</p>
<h4 id="startup">Startup Founder</h4>
<p>I started 3 businesses in Singapore before moving to Sydney. Tagloop - An online store for pre-programmed NFC stickers, Gspot - A platform for launching referral campaigns on Facebook, and <%= link_to "Hastify", "http://hastify.com", :target => 'new'  %> - An online food delivery website. At Hastify, we managed to raise $50,000 from the Singaporean Government, and subsequently an angel round from one of the founders of <%= link_to "Hungrygowhere", "http://hungrygowhere.com", :target => 'new'  %>, the Yelp of Singapore</p>
