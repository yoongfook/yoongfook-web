<p>Finally got Jekyll up and running tonight. What is Jekyll you ask? Well, according to its <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll'>Github page</a>, Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. Thats what it does! It takes all the blogposts you write in markdown and generates a static site from them. You can drop the generated files into any web server and you will be able to serve those pages to your reader.</p>

<p>Jekyll is hacker-style blogging. Write your posts in a text editor in markdown, run <code>rake generate</code>, commit your files, and push it to your site&#8217;s servers. That&#8217;s how you publish a Jekyll-powered blogpost. The posts are served in .html too, which makes the page load extremely fast!</p>
